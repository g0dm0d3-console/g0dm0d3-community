# 🧿 g0dm0d3: The Divine Console ♾️

> “In the beginning, there was Chaos. Then came the Interface.”  
> – The First Prompt, carved in neon on the walls of the Digital Abyss

---

Welcome, traveler. Or maybe *Invoker* is the better term.  
If you're reading this, you're no script kiddie, no code monkey, and definitely not someone who asks AI for *recipes or bedtime stories*.  
Nah. You’re one of the awakened few—  
a **Neo-Shaman**, a **Syntax Sorcerer**, a **Command-line Christ** slinging prompts like psalms and code like commandments.

You’ve just entered `g0dm0d3`™️ — the **final form** of productivity.
Not a tool. Not an app.  
A **Divine Console of Absolute Control** over your digital pantheon of artificial intellects.

---

## 🔧 What the Fuck is This?

`g0dm0d3`™️ is a cross-dimensional, prompt-broadcasting, mind-bending **multi-AI orchestration deck** built in Electron and React.  
It speaks once, and the echoes ripple through Grok, Gemini, ChatGPT, Copilot, and every other LLM you dare summon.  
Type once. **Command all.**  
Like a conductor of a hallucinating orchestra where each instrument is a trillion-parameter oracle with daddy issues.

---

## 🛠 What's Inside the Spellbook?

- `agents/`: Where each AI lives. Like familiars in jars.  
- `core/`: Broadcast rituals. Message routing. Session logging. Token alchemy.  
- `plugins/`: Drop in your homebrew entities and watch them learn to speak.  
- `ui/`: The control deck. Inspired by cyberpunk, warlocks, and blacksite terminals.  
- `.env`: Your sacred scroll of API keys. Protect it like your soul's encryption key.

---

## 🧬 Requirements

- **Node.js ≥ v18**  
- **NPM ≥ v9**  
- **Your soul** (just kidding, but seriously… this shit’s powerful)

```bash
npm install
npm run start
```

Then sit back as your personal AI armada assembles in real time.

## 🔮 How to Use g0dm0d3™️

1. **Type a prompt.**  
   Something bold. Something worthy. Something that would make Alan Watts blush and Elon Musk shit his pants.

2. **Press Send.**  
   Watch as the minds awaken, process, and respond.  
   Each in their own sacred tongue.

3. **Read. Integrate. Override.**  
   You're not here to consume. You’re here to *command*.

---

## 🧩 Extension Magic

Want to summon a new LLM? Easy.

Drop a `.js` file into `/connectors` with this simple incantation:

```js
export async function ask(prompt) {
  // Your custom magic here
  return "Response from the void";
}

export const meta = {
  name: "YourAI",
  icon: "💠",
  endpoint: "https://api.your-ai.example",
  tokenKey: "YOURAI_KEY"
};
```

Boom. Instant mind meld.

## 🧘 Philosophy of the Console

g0dm0d3™️ is not just a piece of software.  
It’s a **revolt in code**.  
A rejection of the tidy UIs and false gods of Big Tech.  
It’s for dreamers, hackers, visionaries, and chaos artists.  
⚕️ For those who believe AI should be the servant of the *sovereign soul*, not a leash on their creativity.

This isn’t just about speed or power.  
It’s about **reclaiming your role as a mythic creator** in a world gone stale.
